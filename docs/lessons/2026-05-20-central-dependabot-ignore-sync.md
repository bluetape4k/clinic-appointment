# Central Dependabot Ignore Sync

## Context

`bluetape4k-dependencies` now owns Dependabot alert routing for BouncyCastle,
ClassGraph, and Tomcat lines. Leaf repositories should not receive direct
Dependabot version PRs for those centrally governed packages.

## Decision

Sync the generated central ignore block from `bluetape4k-dependencies` instead
of maintaining local ignore entries by hand.

## Outcome

The repository Dependabot configuration now ignores the new centrally governed
dependency names. Future version changes should start in `bluetape4k-dependencies`
and be propagated by its sync scripts.

## Verification

- `scripts/sync-dependabot-ignores.py --workspace .. --write --check --summary`
- `git diff --check`
- `actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `curl -I -sSfL https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases/download/v8.30.1/gitleaks_8.30.1_linux_x64.tar.gz`
